## 1. Where, What, and How

For many of the users on the Internet, the question of "I wonder what is going on in my computer" may be the last question for them to ask. In fact, it is also not the question the author of this project would ask if we head back in time for about five years. But here we are. One of the reasons that the author, that is me, decided to make this project is to show many users out there in the wild-world of the Internet that there are something really magical happening in your computer right now!
